For this, each type of demolition waste is tagged with the appropriate six-digit code from the European List of Waste established by Commission Decision 2000/532/EC. When including the type of waste treatment in the Excel spreadsheet (i.e. preparation for reuse, for recycling, material recovery, energy recovery or disposal), evidence is included that the economic operators receiving the waste have the technical capability to carry out this treatment. Such evidence may consist in a link to the company’s webpages where this is documented or a signed statement from a representative of the company. Where the treatment takes place on the demolition site, such as onsite reuse or recycling, acceptable evidence may consist in a signed statement from a representative of the company.. 4. The preparing for re-use(117)‘Preparing for re-use’ means checking, cleaning or repairing recovery operations, by which products or components of products that have become waste are prepared so that they can be re-used without any other pre-processing. This includes, for instance, the preparation for re-use of certain parts of buildings like roof elements, windows, doors, bricks, stones or concrete elements. A pre-requisite for the preparation for re-use of building elements is usually the selective deconstruction of buildings or other structures. or recycling(118)‘Recycling’ means any recovery operation by which waste materials are reprocessed into products, materials or substances whether for the original or other purposes. It includes the reprocessing of organic material but does not include energy recovery and the reprocessing into materials that are to be used as fuels or for backfilling operations. of the non-hazardous construction and demolition waste generated on the construction site is at least 90% (by mass in kilogrammes), excluding backfilling(119)‘Backfilling’ means any recovery operation where suitable non-hazardous waste is used for purposes of reclamation in excavated areas or for engineering purposes in landscaping. Waste used for backfilling must substitute non-waste materials, be suitable for the aforementioned purposes, and be limited to the amount strictly necessary to achieve those purposes.. This excludes naturally occurring material referred to in category 17 05 04 in the European List of Waste established by Commission Decision 2000/532/EC. The operator of the activity demonstrates compliance with the 90% threshold by reporting on the Level(s) indicator 2.2(120)See Level(s) indicator 2.2: Construction and demolition waste and materials, User Manual: introductory briefing, instructions and guidance (Publication version 1.1), https://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/product-bureau//sites/default/files/2021-01/UM3_Indicator_2.2_v1.1_40pp.pdf using the Level 3 reporting format for different waste streams.
